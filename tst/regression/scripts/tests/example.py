"""
Example test script.

This is a complete, working example that can be run as part of the test suite. It does a
simple test of a relativistic shock tube using the GR framework. There are many comments
in order to make this file self-explanatory, but the actual working code is only 28
lines long.

There are three functions defined here:
    prepare(**kwargs)
    run()
    analyze()
All three must be defined with the same names and no inputs in order to make a working
script. They are called in sequence from the main test script run_tests.py. Additional
support functions can be defined here, to be called by the three primary functions.

Heavy use is made of support utilities defined in scripts/utils/athena.py. These are
general-purpose Python scripts that interact with Athena++. They should be used whenever
possible, since they work together to compile and run Athena++ and read the output data.
In particular, proper use of them will result in all files outside tst/regression/ being
in the same state after the test as they were before (including whatever configured
version of Athena++ existed in athena/bin/), as well as cleaning up any new files
produced by the test.
